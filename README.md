# Password Generator

# Project Description:  
Create an application that an employee/organization can use to generate a secure random password based on criteria the user has selected. 

# Requirements: 
Create an application that will create a random password generator. When the user is using the app they will be prompted to select the criteria/characters that they would like their password to contain. Once the user has answered the all the prompts a random password will be generated.

# Configuration: 
This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. All the code that was added to create the password generator was done with JavaScript.
